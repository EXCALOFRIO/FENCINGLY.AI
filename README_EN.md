# FencingAI - Fencing Arbitration Project with AI

[![Versión Española](README_ES.md)](README_ES.md)

This project focuses on developing an artificial intelligence capable of arbitrating fencing videos. The AI will be trained to recognize and evaluate fencing movements, techniques, and rules, allowing for an objective assessment of actions in the videos.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to [Scott (Shalom) Dubinsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdubinsky/), who generously provided the videos from the [fencingdatabase.com](https://www.fencingdatabase.com) database. Without his support and contribution, this project would not have been possible.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop an AI system that can:

- Objectively evaluate fencers' actions in accordance with established rules.

## Technologies Used

The project relies on various technologies and tools, including but not limited to:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the detection and classification of movements.
- Image and video processing for frame analysis.
- Machine learning for action evaluation and arbitration.
